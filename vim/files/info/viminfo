<These are config files to set up a system the way I like it. It now uses [Oh My ZSH](https://github.com/robbyrussell/oh-my-zsh). If you would like to see my old, custom Bash and ZSH config, check out [this branch](https://github.com/ryanb/dotfiles/tree/custom-bash-zsh)

	## Features
	
	Many of the following features are added through the "rbates" Oh My ZSH plugin.
	
	I normally place all of my coding projects in ~/code, so this directory can easily be accessed (and tab completed) with the "c" command.
	
	```terminal
	c railsca<tab>
	```
	
	There is also an "h" command which behaves similar, but acts on the home path.
	
	```terminal
	h doc<tab>
	```
	
	Tab completion is also added to rake and cap commands:
	
	```
	rake db:mi<tab>
	cap de<tab>
	```
	
	To speed things up, the results are cached in local .rake_tasks~ and .cap_tasks~. It is smart enough to expire the cache automatically in most cases, but you can simply remove the files to flush the cache.
	
	If you're using git, you'll notice the current branch name shows up in the prompt while in a git repository.
	
	There are several features enabled in Ruby's irb including history and completion. Many convenience methods are added as well such as "ri" which can be used to get inline documentation in IRB. See irbrc file for details.
