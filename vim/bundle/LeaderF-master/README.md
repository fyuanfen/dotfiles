LeaderF
=======

This plugin is mainly used for locating files, buffers, mrus, tags in large project.

 - Written in Python.
 - Support fuzzy and regex searching.
 - Manage buffers and mrus.
 - Open multiple files at once.
 - [Extensible](https://github.com/Yggdroot/LeaderF-marks).

Screenshots
-----------

![NameOnly Mode][1]

![FullPath Mode][2]

Requirements
------------

 - vim7.3 or higher. Only support vim7.4.330 or higher after [v1.01](https://github.com/Yggdroot/LeaderF/releases/tag/v1.01).
 - vim compiled with Python support, you can check by using `echo has('python')` or `echo has('python3')` to see if the result is `1`; Make sure that your python2 version is Python **2.7** or higher and python3 version is Python **3.1** or higher.

Installation
------------

To install this plugin just put the plugin files in your `~/.vim` (Linux) or `~/vimfiles` (Windows).<br>
For [Vundle][3] user, just add `Plugin 'Yggdroot/LeaderF'` to your `.vimrc`.

Performance
-----------

LeaderF is already very fast. If you want better performance, install the C extension of the fuzzy matching algorithm, which is more than 10 times faster.  
To install the C extension, follow the below:

 - On Linux/Unix/MacOS:

    First, make sure `python` and/or `python3` commands are available.  
    Then run the installation script:

    ```sh
    cd ~/.vim/bundle/LeaderF
    ./install.sh
    ```
    Uninstall the C extension:

        ./install.sh --reverse

    If you are using [vim-plug][5]:

        Plug 'Yggdroot/LeaderF', { 'do': './install.sh' }

 - On Windows:

    First, make sure `py -2` and/or `py -3` commands are available.  
    Then run the installation script:

    ```sh
    cd ~\.vim\bundle\LeaderF
    .\install.bat
    ```
    There may be some error during the installation, please google the error messages to resolve it.  
    For example, `"error: Unable to find vcvarsall.bat"`, you can turn to [here][6] for help.

    Uninstall the C extension:

        .\install.bat --reverse

    If you are using [vim-plug][5]:

        Plug 'Yggdroot/LeaderF', { 'do': '.\install.bat' }

After running any command of LeaderF, check the value of `echo g:Lf_fuzzyMatch_C`, if the value is 1, it means the C extension is loaded sucessfully.

Input formats:

 * In **NameOnly** mode (*fuzzy*)

    `'abc'` is interpreted as vim's regexp `'a.\{-}b.\{-}c'`.<br>
    If the first character you input is `';'`, then the searching will be the same as in **FullPath** mode.<br>
    If you input string as `'abc;def'`, then `'abc'` will match the file name and `'def'` will match the directory name.

 * In **FullPath** mode (*fuzzy*)

    Same as in **NameOnly** mode except that the pattern will match the full path but not the file name only.

 * In **Regexp** mode

    The input string is the same as the Vim's regexp.

Smart Case:

 * If the characters in search pattern are all lowercase, the matching is case-insensitive. If the search pattern contains uppercase characters, all lowercase characters still are matched case-insensitively, the uppercase characters can only match upper case. So uppercase characters can speed up the narrowing down of the searching result.  

    e.g., input `abcDef`ï¼Œit can match the following string:
    ```
    abcDef
    AbcDef
    abcDEf
    aBcDeF
    ```
    but can not match the string such as:
    ```
    abcdef
    Abcdef
    ```
    Note: `abc` and `ef` are still case-insensitive.

Customization
-------------

 * Change key bindings

    By default, `<Tab>` is the shortcut key to switch to normal mode, if you want to change the key into `<ESC>`:

    `let g:Lf_CommandMap = {'<Tab>': ['<ESC>']}`

    for more detail, please refer to [here][7].

 * Customize the statusline

    Please refer to [here][4].

 * Change the highlight of matched string

    ```vim
    highlight Lf_hl_match gui=bold guifg=Blue cterm=bold ctermfg=21
    highlight Lf_hl_matchRefine  gui=bold guifg=Magenta cterm=bold ctermfg=201
    ```

 * Change the default mapping of searching files command

    e.g. `let g:Lf_ShortcutF = '<C-P>'`
